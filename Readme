Readme: WooCommerce Recent Purchase Notifications

This WordPress plugin adds a popup notification box to the front end of WordPress. It then queries past WooCommerce orders to make suggestions to the user about potential purchases that they may wish to make.

Future Steps:
1. Compile CSS into separate file so it can be optimised using plugins such as autoptimize or can be cached by the browser.
2. Compile jQuery code into JS file so it can be optimised using plugins such as autoptimize or can be cached by the browser.
3. Add options page to allow site administrator to select the time period that is queried for past purchases (currently 1 month)
4. Add ability to show recent articles, posts and custom post types instead of or alongside WooCommmerce Product Orders.
5. Add the ability to show recently viewed or "trending" articles.
